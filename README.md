# Console-DiceGame

-  If the difference is 8 or more, the winner gets 3 points.
-  If the difference is between 5 and 7, the winner gets 2 points.
-  If the difference is less than 5, the winner gets 1 point.
6. After each round, the system will display the results and ask if you want to continue to the next round.
